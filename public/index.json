I used it to decompose the reaction time and accuracy data in my recent manuscript: Good Me Bad Me: Does Valence Influence Self-Prioritization During Perceptual Decision-Making.\nHere are a few tips on how to install and use HDDM, in case that you plan to replicate my analyses using the code and data I share here on Github.\nThe targeted reader of this post are Windows users. (I assume that for most Linux users, you, in the most cases, can figure out how to install and use this package, at least with the help from the online forum (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hddm-users)).\nMy system information: Win 10 pro, 64 bit, 16 GB RAM\nStep 1: prepare the python environment: 1.1. Download and install Anaconda 3.6 or 3.7 from https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/.\n1.2. Create virtue python 3.5 environment.\nTo do that, you need first run the Anaconda Prompt, which will be available after you installed Anaconda, as administrator, then run the following code:\nconda create -vv -n py35 python=3.5 jupyter # py35 is the name of the environment, which can be arbitrary 1.3. Activate the py35 env. :\n# To activate this environment, use:\rconda activate py35\r# To deactivate an active environment, use:\rconda deactivate\rStep 2: install HDDM Now you have a python 3.5 environment, you can then install the HDDM package. Of course, you need to activate the py35 environment first. Then:\n2.1. Install HDDM by following code:\nconda install -c pymc hddm # (or conda install -c pymc python=3.5 hddm )\r-proceed?: y\r2.2. Update kabuki, which is crucial package that HDDM depends on, to 0.6.2, otherwise models can not be saved). You can check the version of kabuki to make sure you do have installed 0.6.2\npip install -U --no-deps kabuki --ignore-installed\rconda list # check the version of kabuki Step 3: use HDDM Now, we almost ready. A final step is to use an appropriate editor for editing and running the scripts. I used both jupyter lab (an updated version of jupyter notebook, but you can use jupyter notebook) and spyder. The script files of the former ends with “.ipynb”, the script files of the later one end with “.py”\nTo use jupyter lab, if you like, you need to install jupyter lab in your py35 env. As follows:\nconda install jupyter lab\rAfter that, changing the working directory of anaconda prompt to the folder where you stored the scripts and data, and type jupyter lab to open run jupyter lab. Note the (weird) way to change directory in windows system.\ncd /d c:\\goodme\\2_pilot_study\\Results\\4_hddm\\ # in windows you have to add /d to change the directory\r# run in jupyter lab or jupyter note book, for stim-based modelling\rjupyter lab #(or jupyter notebook if you use jupyter notebook)\rSimilarly, to run in spyder, you need to install spyder in this py35 env. conda install spyder\rThen, type spyder to activate spyder\nspyder # you will need to change the working directory in the script.\rFinal note: I know that there exists the curse of knowledge, which means that I may assume you know what I know but you don’t. So please free feel to post comment or shout out on twitter (@hcp4715) to let me know if you encountered any problem when reproducing my analyses.\n","date":1556475207,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556475207,"objectID":"e6be80305418a176029090bf59dc8e56","permalink":"https://chuan-peng-lab.netlify.app/post/2019-04-29-how-to-install-and-use-hddm/","publishdate":"2019-04-29T02:13:27+08:00","relpermalink":"/post/2019-04-29-how-to-install-and-use-hddm/","section":"post","summary":"Feburary 14, 2021 update: Please note that this blog post was outdated because of the updates of Anaconda/miniconda.\nAugust 2020 update: I’ve created a HDDM docker image, which can be easily installed and used after installing docker.","tags":["DDM","perceptual decision-making","python"],"title":"How to install and use HDDM","type":"post"},{"authors":["Zickfeld JH","Schubert TW","Seibt B","Hu CP","Fiske AP"],"categories":null,"content":"\rClick the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.\rClick the Journal article button below abstract to check all other Preprint in the website.\r","date":1555632000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555632000,"objectID":"a2b7560b24d448b42d4cf6428c834c43","permalink":"https://chuan-peng-lab.netlify.app/publication/2019_publication_zickfeld/","publishdate":"2019-04-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019_publication_zickfeld/","section":"publication","summary":"English-speakers sometimes say that they feel \"moved to tears,\" \"emotionally touched,\" \"stirred,\" or that something \"warmed their heart;\" other languages use similar passive contact metaphors to refer to an affective state.","tags":[],"title":"Kama muta:Conceptualizing and measuring the experience often labelled being moved across 19 nations and 15 languages","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chuan-Peng Hu","Yin JX","Lindenberg SM","Dalğar İ","Weissgerber S","Ijzerman H"],"categories":null,"content":"\rClick the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.\rClick the Journal article button below abstract to check all other Preprint in the website.\r","date":1555459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555459200,"objectID":"a83b8995427929e20f7d9436ba53a292","permalink":"https://chuan-peng-lab.netlify.app/publication/2019_publication_hu/","publishdate":"2019-04-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019_publication_hu/","section":"publication","summary":"In the Human Penguin Project (N = 1755), 15 research groups from 12 countries collected body temperature, demographic variables, social network indices, seven widely-used psychological scales and two newly developed questionnaires (the Social Thermoregulation and Risk Avoidance Questionnaire (STRAQ-1) and the Kama Muta Frequency Scale (KAMF)).","tags":[],"title":"Data from the Human Penguin Project, a cross-national dataset testing social thermoregulation principles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["YIN Jixing","HU Chuanpeng"],"categories":null,"content":"\rClick the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.\rClick the Journal article button below abstract to check all other Preprint in the website.\r","date":1548892800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548892800,"objectID":"d8713a88d7f528766b6c25e0b7a787f6","permalink":"https://chuan-peng-lab.netlify.app/publication/2019_publication_yin_cn/","publishdate":"2019-01-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019_publication_yin_cn/","section":"publication","summary":"Behavioral and neuroscientific methods have uniquely contributed to our understanding of human mind and behavior.
