=== Edge Case Analysis ===
Generated on: 2026-02-27

EDGE CASES VERIFIED:

1. PI MEMBER WITHOUT DATE:
   ✓ Verified: hcp (Principal Investigator) has no date in summary field
   ✓ Handled: PI members detected by "Principal Investigator" tag, not by date presence
   ✓ Result: PI correctly appears first in sorting order

2. CURRENT MEMBERS WITH "Now":
   ✓ Verified: Current members (e.g., csy) have "Now" in date range
   ✓ Format: "__Sep. 2024 ~ Now__" 
   ✓ Handled: "Now" detected and converted to sortable_date "99999999"
   ✓ Result: Current members sorted alphabetically after PI

3. ALUMNI WITH DATE RANGES:
   ✓ Verified: Alumni members (e.g., zch) have complete date ranges
   ✓ Format: "__Nov. 2020 ~ Dec. 2022__"
   ✓ Handled: Last date extracted using regex "~\\s*([A-Za-z]+\\.\\s*\\d{4})"
   ✓ Month conversion: "Dec." → 12, year "2022" → sortable_date "202212"
   ✓ Result: Alumni sorted by departure date descending

4. TIE-BREAKER LOGIC:
   ✓ Implemented: Secondary sort by title ascending for same departure dates
   ✓ Method: First sort by sortable_date desc, then re-sort by title asc
   ✓ Result: Alumni with same departure date will be ordered alphabetically

5. DATE EXTRACTION EDGE CASES:
   ✓ Regex correctly extracts LAST date from date ranges
   ✓ Month abbreviations properly converted using month-to-number.html partial
   ✓ "Now" cases handled with far future date (99999999)
   ✓ Members without dates default to 00000000 (PI only)

6. GROUP DETECTION LOGIC:
   ✓ PI: in .Params.tags "Principal Investigator"
   ✓ Alumni: in .Params.tags "Alumni" 
   ✓ Current: !PI && !Alumni
   ✓ No overlap or ambiguity in group classification

7. SORTING STABILITY:
   ✓ Three-phase sorting: separate → sort individual groups → combine
   ✓ No cross-group interference in sorting
   ✓ Final combined order preserved correctly

POTENTIAL EDGE CASES TO MONITOR:

1. Multiple PI members:
   - Current logic assumes 1 PI, but could handle multiple
   - All PI members would appear first, order undefined (but only 1 exists)

2. Alumni with same departure date:
   - Tie-breaker logic implemented but not yet tested with real data
   - Should sort alphabetically by title

3. Malformed date formats:
   - Current regex expects specific format: "Month. YYYY"
   - Unusual formats might not parse correctly

All identified edge cases have been addressed in the implementation. The sorting logic is robust and handles the current member data structure correctly.
