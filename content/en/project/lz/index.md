I obtained an M.Ed. in Educational Psychology from the University of Sydney and a B.Sc. in Psychology from both Australian National University and Southwest University. My research focuses on three main areas: 
- First, I explore behavioural decision-making and its underlying psychological mechanisms. By integrating psychological experiments with cognitive modelling (e.g., reinforcement learning), I aim to enhance our understanding of real-world decision-making and offer insights for policy development. 
- Second, I study social cognition, with a particular interest in how people process information related to themselves and others. 
- Lastly, I value open, transparent, and reproducible research. I conduct meta research to investigate the effectiveness of the methodologies and practices (e.g., pre-registration, registered report) in psychology.  


Research Field: Behavioural Decision Making, Social Cognition, Meta-research
