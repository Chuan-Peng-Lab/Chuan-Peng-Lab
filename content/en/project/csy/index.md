 I am such a curious girl thirsty for the truth of this world, and also trying to explore myself! Studying can be one of my interests. Besides, books related to psychology, ideas of philosophy and music which is classic or Jazz are all my favorites.  I love the rational thinking which means I am always ready to talk about any interesting but also critical topics with you.
