Welcome to the Meta-Self Lab!

The lab is led by Prof., Dr., Hu Chuan-Peng at the School of Psychology, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, China. We are interested in how human beings process self-related information, with a "3M" approach: meta-science, (cognitive) modeling, and (psychological) measurement. We are also trying to apply the "3M" approach to the mental health issues in the real world.

Openness, transparency, and reproducibility are core values in our research. We keep learning new methods and and adopting new practices to make our research as rigorous and robust as possible. 

Equality is another core value of our lab. We are dedicated to fostering a culture where everyone involved is respected and every idea is valued.
