abstract: Open Science is becoming a mainstream scientific ideology in psychology
  and related fields. However, due to inadequate research infrastructures,
  limited resources, and a lack of local support amongst various other 
  difficulties, researchers - especially early career researchers (ECRs) in
  developing countries - are facing significant hurdles in moving Open Science
  forward. In China, ECRs often feel discouraged from participating in Open Science
  for reasons such as language barriers and the lack of dedicated communication
  channels. To bridge this gap, the Chinese Open Science Network (COSN) started
  with a simple wish to make the voice of Open Science heard by Chinese-speaking
  ECRs and scholars at large.With the core values of grassroots-oriented,
  diversity, and inclusivity, COSN has grown from a small open science interest
  group to a recognized organization both in the Chinese-speaking community and
  Open Science community. Since its inaugural event in 2016, COSN has organized
  three in-person workshops, 55 journal club sessions, 38 talks, 12 tutorials,
  and translated 15 Open Science English articles and blogs into Chinese.
  Currently, the COSN official WeChat account has more than 22,000 subscribers,
  and more than 1,000 researchers/students actively participate in the
  discussions on Open Science. In this paper, COSN shares its experiences of
  developing such networks and hopefully they are helpful for ECRs in other
  developing countries who would like to start their Open Science initiatives.
  We foresee great collaborative efforts of COSN together with all other local
  and international networks to further accelerate the Open Science movement.
