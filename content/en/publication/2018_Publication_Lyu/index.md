abstract: This article introduces the raw data available for anyone who is interested in examining how students and researchers misinterpret of P-value and CIs, as well as how NHST and CIs influence the interpretation of research results. Part of the results had been reported in our previous Chinese paper. This study was approved by the local ethics committee (Ethical Committee of the Department of Psychology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China). A written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki were presented (online survey) or read by an experimenter (for paper-pen survey) to respondents before they began the survey.
