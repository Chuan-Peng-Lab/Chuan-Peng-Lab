abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic(and its aftermath) highlights a critical need to communicate health information effectively to the global public.Given that subtle differences in information framing can have meaningful effects on behavior,behavioral science research highlights a pressing question:Is it more effective to frame COVID-19 health messages in terms of potential losses (e.g.,“If you do not practice these steps, you can endanger yourself and others”)or potential gains (e.g.,“If you practice these steps, you can protect yourself and others”)? Collecting data in 48 languages from 15,929 participants in 84 countries, we experimentally tested the effects of message framing on COVID-19-related judgments, intentions, and feelings.Loss-(vs. gain-) framed messages increased self-reported anxiety among participants cross-nationally with little-to-no impact on policy attitudes, behavioral intentions, or information seeking relevant to pandemic risks.These results were consistent across 84 countries, three variations of the message framing wording, and 560 data processing and analytic choices.Thus, results provide an empirical answer to a global communication question and highlight the emotional toll of loss-framed messages.Critically, this work demonstrates the importance of considering unintended affective consequences when evaluating nudge-style interventions.
